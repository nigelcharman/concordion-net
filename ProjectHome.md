## Where is the project now? ##

The project is a stable beta version now.  It has full compatibility with the Java Concordion language.  It has not been widely tested though and this is why the alpha label continues to stay on the project.

## Where is it going? ##

There are many improvements in the works:

  * Allow use of embedded resources to write specifications much like Java Concordion.
  * Continue providing compliance with the Java Concordion language
  * Provide better embedding of Concordion results into the Gallio reports (one-stop shop for reports)
  * Anything else you can think of!
